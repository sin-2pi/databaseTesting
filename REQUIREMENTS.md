# Process Summary

An insurance policy is what the insured pay for to protect their items, and it is what reThought covers in case of a claim filed by the insured. 

First off, the party to be insured gets their broker to send a submission to reThought requesting coverage. That submissions has data about the party requesting to be insured, and the broker. From there, the submission goes through the underwriting process where a person (underwriter) and a system assess the risk of insuring this party, determining their eligibility for coverage.

reThought covers buildings as well as contents and loss of use, but strictly from flood damage. So if the insured party has their physical business damaged, as well as some equipment, they can be reimbursed for their lease\rent over the time period it takes for repairs to be completed, and they can be compensated for damaged equipment ALONG with the physical building damage.

After the underwriting process, a quote is sent to the broker. The broker sends that to the party to be insured. If they accept, the broker sends the an official 'binder' to reThought, and reThought sends the policy to the broker and insured, the policy has legal details of the coverage. An invoice is sent to the broker, the insured pays the broker, the broker pays reThought.

If there is a loss, the insured party submits a claim. From there, an adjuster reviews the loss and claim determining how much should be paid out to the insured, if any.
